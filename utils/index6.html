  You must use a monospace font (also known as typewriter font). That is a font in which all the characters take the same space.

In CSS the font name monospace is translated to the default monospace font on the user system. It's good practice to include monospace at the end of a font-familly list for the <pre> element so that it can be used as a fallback.

For instance:

</pre>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>你好</td>
    <td>你好</td>
    <td>你好</td>
    <td>你好</td>
    <td>你好</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>你好</td>
    <td>你好</td>
    <td>你好</td>
    <td>你好</td>
    <td>你好</td>
  </tr>
</table>
